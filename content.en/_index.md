The Sample University Particle Physics Experimental Laboratory explores the fundamental laws of the universe through experimental particle physics. [Sample Data]
We conduct precision measurements of neutrino properties and direct searches for dark matter using large-scale accelerator experiments and underground detector facilities.
From the development of state-of-the-art detector technologies to large-scale data analysis, our students and researchers tackle the frontiers of fundamental science together.
By probing physics beyond the Standard Model, we aim to unravel the mysteries of the early universe.
