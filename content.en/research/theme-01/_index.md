## Overview

Neutrinos are electrically neutral, light fermions that undergo "oscillations"—inter-generational flavor transitions—during propagation.
Precision measurements of these oscillation parameters provide crucial clues to physics beyond the Standard Model.

## Details

We participate in long-baseline neutrino experiments to measure the mixing angles θ₁₃ and θ₂₃ and the CP-violation phase δ.
Searches for CP violation are key to understanding the matter-dominated universe.
We also develop calibration techniques for large water-Cherenkov detectors and advanced statistical analysis methods.
