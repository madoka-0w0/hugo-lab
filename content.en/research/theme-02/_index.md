## Overview

Dark matter accounts for approximately 27% of the mass-energy content of the universe, yet its nature remains unknown.
We aim to directly detect interactions of WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles), one of the leading dark matter candidates, using high-sensitivity detectors.

## Details

We operate liquid-xenon detectors deep underground, where cosmic-ray backgrounds are minimal, searching for elastic scattering signals between WIMPs and atomic nuclei.
Our group develops waveform analysis algorithms to distinguish signal from background events and performs precision calibrations of the electric-field response.
